# IMAGE-CONVERTION
Achieved 40â€“60% reduction in image file sizes using Python, Pillow, and OpenCV to optimize web performance by converting bulky JPEG/PNG images to efficient WebP and SVG formats.
Improved workflow efficiency for developers by building a Tkinter-based GUI tool that supports batch image conversion, addressing the repetitive and time-consuming nature of manual optimization.
Ensured high image quality and scalability across formats through research-driven development and automated testing, solving challenges related to compression efficiency and fidelity retention.
